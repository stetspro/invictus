helix_lorem = "Even the most powerful pirate forces need a good infrastructure and networks. Because of this, the Helix Collective was founded by four well known
                pirate leaders. Their common goal is the liberation of space as we know it. To reach their goal, most members of the Helix Collective stop at nothing.
                Many people leave their families and homes behind in hope to become the next rich but also feared person. Due to their aggresive behavior, the Helix Collective
                built some of the greatest Warships out there. Featuring a whole lot of weapon slots and a from the ground up rebuilt targeting processor, these machines shine with their raw gunpower."

                    guiding principle always was impartiality. They have never been in a war with external parties. Due to their neutrality, the Caldarius Federation
                    steadily improved their defense capabilites in case of trouble. Their ships are primarily known for their especially reinforced hulls and their
                    massive shields that can stand a large enemy fleets."

              been some civil wars due to different opinions about drugs and weapons in the past but the Core Republic always grows stronger with every one of them.<br>Since
              everyone is able to choose their own path of career, most people became Freighter-Pilots. After decades of researching on how to increase the storage capacity of ships even more,
              they have been able to celebrate their first breakthroughs not very long ago."

# Thomas French Monument
thomas_french_description = "<p><strong>THOMAS FRENCH - INTREPID TRADE PIONEER</strong></p><br>

<p>For as long as anyone could remember, the computers ran the stations.  Every purchase and every sale was initiated and fulfilled by trade AI that collaborated and cooperated, setting the prices for the entire galaxy.  But wild price fluctuations and artificial scarcity gave rise to risky bartering over an ad hoc gray market called The Lithium Exchange.  One party would jettison the requested cargo, and the other would wire credits directly to the other's account, both risking everything and operating solely on an honor system.  This was not a stable foundation.  Thomas French changed all that.</p>

<p>After using his wealth to amass a sizable fleet, French and his associates commandeered an industrial station in Odin - a region of space then controlled by the Helix Collective - with the intent to convert it into the galaxy's first free market station.  He succeeded in liberating this outpost, but did not expect their retaliation.  The Collective struck back with all their might.  Sudden, overwhelming force poured forth from Alba and Latos, eliminating the flagship French was aboard, believing it would end the endeavor.</p>

<p>It did not.  The galactic community rallied behind his cause, galvanized by his loss, and drove the Collective's fleets back from where they came.  Odin would become the galaxy's new trade hub, a neutral zone where the people chose what to sell and what to pay.  And it all sprang forth by the vision and boldness of one man.</p>

<p>The galaxy honors the memory of Thomas French with this monument.</p>"
